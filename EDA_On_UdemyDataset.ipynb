        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Udemy courses dataset. The goal is to uncover insights about course content, pricing, subscribers, and trends across time and categories. The analysis leverages Python’s data analysis stack to answer a set of guiding business and product questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook investigates questions such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Course Titles**: frequent words, longest/shortest titles, title-based recommendation ideas.\n",
        "* **Subjects/Categories**: distribution across categories, popularity trends per year, subscriber preferences.\n",
        "* **Published Year**: growth of courses over time, identification of peak years.\n",
        "* **Levels**: distribution of course difficulty levels and their popularity.\n",
        "* **Duration**: how course length correlates with subscribers and pricing.\n",
        "* **Subscribers**: most popular courses, average subscribers, breakdown per subject/year.\n",
        "* **Pricing**: average, minimum, maximum prices, revenue estimates, most profitable courses.\n",
        "* **Correlations**: relationship between subscribers and reviews, price, lectures, and duration.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tech Stack\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Python 3.x**\n",
        "* **Jupyter Notebook**\n",
        "* Libraries:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * `pandas` for data manipulation\n",
        "  * `numpy` for numerical analysis\n",
        "  * `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "## Repository Contents\n",
        "\n",
        "* `EDA on UdemyDataset.ipynb` – the main notebook with all analysis and visualizations.\n",

        "## How to Run\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Clone this repository.\n",
        "2. Install dependencies:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```bash\n",
        "   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter\n",
        "   ```\n",
